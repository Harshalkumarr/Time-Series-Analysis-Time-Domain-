This jupyter notebook is uploaded by using command line using local git.

The file explains about how to visualize your time series for further analysis.

The time series analysis is used for prediction/forecasting future data.

When we analyze time series data in time domain,we try to estimate parameters by observing
trends in visualization.Therefore time series analysis in time domain is parametric process.

Here matplotlib and pandas library is used to get initial guess about trends in time series data.
